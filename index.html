                        <p>STEM is an acronym that stands for (S)cience, (T)echnology, (E)ngineering, and (M)athematics. The acronym usually accompanies any sorts of programs or activities that emphasize learning in these fields and typically is targeted towards the younger generations. Throughout the world, the world's biggest problems are solved using these core educational subjects, so it's important that students across the world are provided the opportunity to engage with the tools and techniques that enable us to create amazing things that we use everyday!</p>

                        <hr></hr>

                        <p>One of the major advantages you gain from obtaining a degree in computer science from Oklahoma Baptist University is that you aren't limited to learning a bunch of different coding languages. Instead, you are provided with opportunities to dozens of different skillsets that are all applicable to the wider world of business. With solid foundations in mathematics, applied physics, and business fundamentals, you will come away with not only the knowledge and skills necessary to develop compelling software the solves problems, but also the understanding of how your software impacts an entire organization or community. Graduates from OBU have gone on to fill in dozens of complex business-oriented rolls that were complimented by their technical and creative training during their time at OBU.

                        <h3>Encrpytion Fundamentals</h3>

                        <p>Technical computing has its origin in the obfuscation of vital information. People who needed to hide critical details about their efforts (often in times of conflict) from hostile parties would rely on complex algorithm-like encodings that would mask their secrets behind difficult-to-crack ciphertexts. This site showcases three different types of encoding methods (Caeser Cipher, Rail Fence Cipher, and Substitution Cipher), as well as how they work and how they are decrypted. Our STEM Day demonstration allows participants to interactively use data analyzing techniques that are often used to understand ciphertext generated through the Substitution Cipher.</p>

                        <h3>Data Classification</h3>

                        <p>Across the world, statistical information is collected over hundreds of thousands of different topics. That data, to be useful, has to be processed in a feasiblely efficient and engaging way. Understanding the mathematical foundations behind interpretting this data is an unprecedented skill in the modern day. Our STEM Day demonstration allowed participants to interactively engage with data-collection methods, and understand how that data is then classified into a meaningful numerical entry.</p>
