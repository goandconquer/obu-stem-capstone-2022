# obu-stem-capstone-2022
This project was originally developed to provide a series of computer-science related activities for capturing the interest of prospective students visiting Oklahoma Baptist University in April of 2022. The original project featured activities such a primitive machine learning model and several encryption methods. This repository does not contain all of the original project files. Instead, it contains a selection of files that I personally wrote for the project that still provide demonstrable experience in front-end design. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without frameworks. It also features an alternative Python web server for computing and communicating the encryption tool's input and output.
